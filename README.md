# CS573 Project Proposal Rough Draft

# Data
In this project, I would use "Crimes against to woman in India" dataset. https://gist.github.com/lzlazmSylas/6be318f1ef48498d10f831bbd78782f3
I will visualize this data set in my project.  
**Attribute**  
- STATE: state in india  
- DISTRICT: district in state  
- Year: The time that crime happened  
- Rape: number of rape  
- Kidnapping_and_Abduction:  number of kindnapping and abduction
- Dowry_Deaths:  number of dowry death
- Assault_on_women:  number of assaulting
- Insult_to_modesty_of_Women:  number of insulting case
- Cruelty_by_Husband_or_his_Relatives : number of cruelty by hubsband or victim's relatives
# Questions and Tasks
- Which state have highest total number of crimes.
- Which state have highest number of crimes for each type of crime.
- Which state's crime rate is showing a downward trend.
- Which state's crime rate is showing a upward trend.
- What kind of crime take the largest precentage among the all kind of crimes.
# Sketches

The first bar chart can use number of crimes as X coordinate and use each state bound to Y coordinate, so it is claer to tell which state have the most crimes in a specified crime if I just use one bar chart for only one type of crime.
The second line chart use timeline as X coordinate and if I use number of one type of crimes as Y coordinate, I can easily tell the crime tendency of each state, but I can only figure out tends for one type of crime among states in India in each line chart.
The third sketche allow me to identify the percentages of types of crimes, then I can compare each crime and find answer of the last question.
# Prototype
![image](https://github.com/lzlazmSylas/CS573_Project_Proposal_Rough_Draft/blob/main/prototype.png)  
In this prototype I visulize the total number of reported rape cases in India from 2001 to 2014, we can tell which sate has the most rape cases in India so this bar chart helps to answer the second question. But since the total amoung of each case is super large, it is little bit difficult to show all the crimes in a single bar chart. 
# Questions
This data set have large number of unique state(more than 20), so whatever sketche I used to help me to doing the research, the chart will rather messy. What should I do to make chart smoothly? If tree or network chart good for this project?
